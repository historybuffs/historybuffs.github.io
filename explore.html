  <p>Welcome to our web map! Here you can find the locations of every property listed on the National Park Service's 
    National Registry of Historic Places. Below, you can filter by the area of significance of each property, search 
    by address and the names of the properties, create buffer zones around any location, and create routes between any
    two points (and add any stops along the way). Happy exploring!</p>
