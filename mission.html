  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>Since the 1990s, 1,769 Historical sites have been delisted by the National Park Service(NPS). Losing the NPS's recognition is a huge blow for these sites, as without the funding provided by the NPS many of these sites will fall into disrepair. Even sites listed by the NPS as historical sites have issues with funding, as there are about 71,000 sites which have had to defer maintenance due to budget shortages within the NPS. Our mission for this project is to reignite public interest in cultural and historic landmarks, in the hopes that this will spread awareness of the precarious position many landmarks are experiencing currently. With this newfound interest we also hope to increase donations for these sites so that they are not at risk of falling into disrepair.</p>
