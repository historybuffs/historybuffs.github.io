  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  

  
  <p>Across the country, our historic landmarks face growing pressure that threaten their survival. Since the 1990s alone, 1,769 of these historical sites have been delisted by the 
    National Park Service. Losing the NPS's recognition is a huge blow for these sites, as without its funding, many of these 
    sites will fall into disrepair. </p>
  
  <p>(NRHP) is the official list of the country’s historic sites seen as worthy of 
    preservation by the National Park Service. It was authorized by the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 
    and is part of a plan to “coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's 
    historic and archeological resources”. Even sites officially recognized by the NPS via inclusion on the NRHP have issues with 
    funding; 71,000 sites have had to defer maintenance due to budget shortages. </p>

  <p> Our mission for this project is to support the NPS’s goals by reigniting public interest in cultural and historic landmarks in the hopes that this will 
    spread awareness of the precarious position many of these sites are currently experiencing. With this newfound interest we 
    also hope to increase involvement with the NPS, whether through donations of time or money, in order to decrease the risk 
    of falling into disrepair. </p>

    <p>The United States has a rich legacy surrounding its landmarks and historical sites. From the Gold Rush towns of California 
    to the Revolutionary War sites of Massachusetts, these places represent a wealth of heritage and culture, as well as the 
    opportunity for education through tourism and local discovery. Recently, the current political administration proposed 
    funding cuts for the National Park Service (NPS). As a result, the NPS would suffer a loss of $1.2 billion in funding, 
    putting the preservation and maintenance of many historical sites at severe risk.</p>
